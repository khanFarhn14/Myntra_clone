This was given as an internship assignment I've completed the task you've given and uploaded the video

Here's something about me: I've been looking for internships since November 2022 and many companies have given me many assignments

My curiosity was piqued because I wanted to see how the application was made in real time I've never cared about the stipend I just wanted to work with an experienced team and learn from them. I knew that this was a chance for me to gain the knowledge and experience I needed to become a better developer. So I decided to take the plunge and apply.  

I was given a login page UI and told to code within 5 hours
Yet I submitted, but I didn't get any feedback or response after I submitted

Another company told me to build an authentication page that takes a phone number and verifies with OTP. I did, but didn't hear anything back.
